# Deep Thoughts
MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) tech stack.

A social media application where users can share their thoughts and opinions about anything that moves them. They will be able to befriend one another and comment on each other's posts.

`A user can sign up and log in to the application.`

`A user can post their thoughts and view other user's thoughts.`

`A user can react, or reply, to a thought.`

`A user can befriend other users.`

## Deployed App
https://afternoon-everglades-19500.herokuapp.com/


## What You Will Learn
By completing this module, you'll learn how to do the following:

Explain the difference between GraphQL and RESTful APIs.

Configure a proxy server for local development of a MERN application.

Implement client-side routing using React Router.

Build API endpoints with GraphQL in a MERN application.

Successfully configure and deploy a MERN application to Heroku.

Implement authentication with JWT.


## You’ll use the following tools in this module:
`GraphQL` (Links to an external site.) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling queries with your existing data, giving clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more. For this module’s application, you’ll use the graphql (Links to an external site.) package to parse GraphQL syntax in both your front-end and back-end codebase.

`Apollo Server` (Links to an external site.) is an open-source, spec-compliant GraphQL server that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including `Apollo Client` (Links to an external site.), the client you’ll use in your MERN application. You’ll use the `apollo-server-express` (Links to an external site.) package to integrate GraphQL into your Express.js server, and the `@apollo/client` (Links to an external site.) package to make requests from your React front end to the GraphQL API.

`React Router` (Links to an external site.) is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application, allowing you to make your single-page React applications behave more like multi-page applications. You’ll use the `react-router-dom` (Links to an external site.) npm package to work with React Router in your applications.

The `concurrently` (Links to an external site.) npm package allows you to run multiple processes, or servers, from a single command-line interface. Rather than opening multiple terminals to start the multiple servers, you can run them both at the same time. It also allows you to keep track of different outputs in one place, and will stop all of your processes if even one of them fails.

`JSON Web Tokens`, or JWTs, are an alternative to using session cookies for authentication. You’ll use the jsonwebtoken (Links to an external site.) package in your MERN applications.

`jwt-decode` (Links to an external site.) is an npm package that helps decode JWTs from their Base64Url encoding. You’ll use it to extract non-sensitive data such as the token’s expiration date to see if it’s expired before making a request to the server.

The `faker` (Links to an external site.) npm package allows you to generate massive amounts of fake data in the development environment of your Node.js applications.

The `nodemon` (Links to an external site.) package simplifies your development environment by automatically restarting your Node.js applications when file changes in the directory are detected.
